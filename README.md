# WP Dash Cleaner

A WordPress plugin to customize and clean up the WordPress dashboard menu, giving administrators granular control over user access to core features.

## Description

WP Dash Cleaner is an essential tool for WordPress site administrators who need to streamline the user experience in the dashboard. By default, the WordPress dashboard can be overwhelming for clients or content creators, with many menu items and features that they don't need or shouldn't access.

This plugin allows administrators to hide menu items for specific user roles, ensuring that users only see what is relevant to their tasks. Whether you want to simplify the interface for a client, restrict a content editor to only writing posts, or prevent a user from accidentally modifying core settings, WP Dash Cleaner has you covered.

**Key Features:**

* **Granular Menu Control:** Hide or show main menu items like Posts, Pages, Media, Comments, Appearance, and Plugins based on user roles.
* **Force Plugin Usage:** By hiding default WordPress features (e.g., Media or Comments), you can effectively force users to interact with a specific third-party plugin that provides similar functionality (e.g., a different media library or a custom comment system).
* **Simplify the User Interface:** Create a clean, distraction-free environment for your users by removing unnecessary menu clutter.
* **Enhanced Security:** Prevent unauthorized users from accessing or modifying sensitive parts of the dashboard.
* **Easy-to-Use Interface:** A simple settings page in the WordPress admin area allows you to toggle menu visibility with just a few clicks.
